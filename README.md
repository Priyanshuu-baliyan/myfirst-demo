👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm Priyanshu Baliyan 👋

🎓 B.Tech Student
🌐 Web Development Enthusiast

I created this repository when I started learning Git and GitHub.
It represents the foundation of my development journey — the moment I moved from just writing code to managing and version-controlling projects like a developer.

📖 About This Repository

This repository was created as a practice project while learning:

✅ Git basics (init, add, commit, status)

✅ Branching & merging

✅ Repository management

✅ Remote repositories

✅ Open-source workflow fundamentals

Although simple, this repo marks the transition from beginner curiosity to structured learning.
